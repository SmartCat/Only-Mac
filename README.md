Original idea: https://github.com/AntonyCorbett/OnlyM (Windows)

This is an app that provides base functionality of Only-M for macOS users. 
This app gives an ability to display images/video on second monitor controlling them from main monitor.
So, on second monitor there are no distraction UI elements and unnecessary mouse movement.
